Widget Rules
============

One of the most powerful features of QtPyVCP are the Widget Rules. Widget
Rules are a flexible way of making widgets respond to changes in external data.

Rules can be used for things as simple as making a label display the current
machine position, or as complicated as hiding, showing and rearranging widgets
and layouts.

Each widget can have multiple rules applied to it, and each rule can make use
of data from multiple sources.

Terms
^^^^^

Here are some definitions of terms that will be used on this page. They probably
won't make much sense at this point but don't worry about that now. It will all
come together after a few examples.

**Rule**: *A rule defines how one aspect of the widget changes in response to
external data.* For example a rule might be used to set the text in a label, to
enable or disable a button. A widget may have many rules applied to it.

**Data Source**: *A data source is something the provides data channels.* Examples
of a data source are ``status`` which provides machine status updates, and
``tooltable`` which provides data on the tools in the tool table.

**Data Channel**: *A data channel provides a single set of data which can be used
in the rules expression.* Examples of data channels are ``status:tool_in_spindle``
and ``tooltable:current_tool?comment``.

**Rules Expression**: *A rules expression is a python expression which you can use
to manipulate the data from the data channels.**


--------------
Creating Rules
--------------

Rules are created and edited using a special **Rules Editor** dialog in QtDesigner.

On the left side of the dialog is a list of all the rules applied to the widget.
On the right side is where you edit the rules by selecting what aspect of the widget
they affect, what data channels to source data from, and the expression which brings
is all together.

    Rules Editor


Opening the Editor
******************

With a VCP open in designer, right-click on a widget and in the Task Menu
select the **Edit Widget Rules...** option. You may also be able to double
click on the widget to open the rules editor.

Here is a step-by-step on how to open the **Rules Editor**.

    Opening the Rules Editor


Adding A New Rule
*****************

With the *Rules Editor* open, add a rule by clicking on the **Add Rule** button
on the top left or delete a rule by clicking on the **Remove Rule** button.

- **Set the Rule Name**
    The rule name can be anything you like, but it should be something meaningful and
    make it clear to others what the rule does.

- **Select the Property**
    The property combo box will display a list of widget properties that the rule can
    control. Select the property you would like to have the rule change. Notice that
    that the blue **Exp. Type** value at the bottom of the window changes depending on
    the property you select. This indicate the type of value the Expression should return.

- **Channels**
    Add at least one channel to be used to trigger the rule and provide a value
    for use in the expression. To do this click at the **Add Channel** button on
    top of the table and fill in the channel address. The channel address format
    is ``datasource:channel_name?query``. Type the first letter of the `Data
    Plugin` to get a list of channels for that plugin. 

    Examples::

        status:paused                       # bool, whether the machine is paused or not
        status:joint[0].homed               # bool, whether joint No. 0 is homed
        position:abs?string&axis=x          # string, current absolute position of the X axis
        tootlable:current_tool              # dict, dictionary of current tool data
        tootlable:current_tool?diameter     # float, query diameter of the currently loaded tool
        tootlable:current_tool?comment      # string, query comment for the currently loaded tool

    If a query is not explicitly given it will default to ``?value``. Example: ``status:paused``
    is equivalent to ``status:paused?value``.

    The **Trigger** option defines if the expression will be evaluated or not when
    that channel's value changes. At least one channel must be marked as a **Trigger**.

    With the channel(s) added it is time to create the expression.

.. _Expression:

- **Expression**
    To use data from the **channels** in the expression you used the special
    function ``ch[chan_num]``, where ``chan_num`` is the number that is shown in
    the left column of the channels list. For example, ``ch[0]`` in an expression
    will be replaced with that channels value when the expression is evaluated.

    When the user selects a property, the **Expected Type** label is updated with
    the data type the expression should return.

    It is the user responsibility to cast the data properly and ensure that the
    proper data type (or equivalent) is the result of the evaluation. If you make
    a mistake a warning box will pop up when saving the rule giving you a chance to
    go back and fix it.

Examples

Set text in label
*****************

Here is a basic rule which will set the text in a label to "X Homed" if
joint 0 is homed (ch[0] is True), or to "X Unhomed" if joint 0 is not homed
(ch[0] is False). Channel 0 data type is `bool` which means it is either true or
false. The expression reads like this `set the label text to X Homed if channel
0 is true else set the text label to X Unhomed`.

.. figure:: /_static/rules/homed_label_example.png

    Rule to set label text according to homed status.

Style Class
***********

To use the Style Class create a style in the css file and use the rule to set
or unset that style. The following is placed in the ui/style.css file.
::

  StatusLabel[style='red_text']{
    color:red;
  }

  StatusLabel[style='green_text']{
    color:green;
  }
