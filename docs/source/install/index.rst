There are multiple ways to install QtPyVCP, either a development install, or a standard
install from PyPi. Which one you choose depends on how you intend to use QtPyVCP.

.. Note::

    Regardless of which installation method you use you will need to make sure the
    prerequisites listed on the :doc:`Prerequisites <prerequisites>` page have been met.


Standard Install
----------------

If you are not interested in contributing to QtPyVCP, then it is best to install
from PyPi per the :doc:`Standard Install <pypi_install>` guide.


Development Install
-------------------

If you would like to contribute to QtPyVCP you will need to follow the
:doc:`Development Install <dev_install>` guide.
