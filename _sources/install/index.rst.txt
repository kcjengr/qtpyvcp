There are multiple ways to install QtPyVCP, either a development install, or a standard
install from PyPi. Which one you choose depends on how you intend to use QtPyVCP.

.. Warning::

    QtPyVCP main branch is currently python3 only, there is no stable release for python3 yet


.. Note::

    Regardless of which installation method you use you will need to make sure the
    prerequisites listed on the :doc:`Prerequisites <prerequisites>` page have been met.
