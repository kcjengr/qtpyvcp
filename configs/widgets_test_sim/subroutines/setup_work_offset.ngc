o<setup_work_offset> sub
(Setup subroutine for work offset)
(Moves machine to specific position and sets G54 work offset)
(This ensures test G-code files start at a known location)

(Move to machine coordinates)
G53 G0 Z0 (Z to safe position first)
G53 G0 X8.0 Y-4.0 (Move to XY position in machine coordinates)

(Set current machine position as work coordinate system zero)
G10 L20 P1 X0 Y0 Z0 (P1 = G54, set this position as X0 Y0 Z0)

(Activate G54)
