HAL Widgets
-----------

These widgets generate HAL pins by which they can control or be
controlled by external HAL signals. HAL signals must be connected
in the ``POSTGUI_HALFILE`` since they do not exist until the GUI
has been fully loaded.

All pins belong to the ``qtpyvcp`` HAL component. Pin names are
derived from the widget's ObjectName as set in designer, with any
underscores replaced by dashes.
