=========================
Prerequisites for python3
=========================

QtPyVCP can be installed and run on most reasonably modern PCs and operating systems.
There are a few requirements that need to be satisfied, however, and it's best to
verify that the system is indeed capable of running QtPyVCP before installing.

These requirements are the same regardless of the install method.


System Requirements
-------------------


* Debian 11 (bullseye) or 12 (bookworm) 64 bit ( Debian 10 latest Qt is 5.11 )
* Python 3.7
* Qt 5.12 or more recent
* LinuxCNC **2.9** branch master, installed as a Run In Place (RIP) built from source, debian buster buildbot packages or debian bookworm packages
* Graphics card that supports OpenGL 1.50 or later (for VTK backplot)

.. Note::
    QtPyVCP requires a x86_64 operating systems, x86_32 systems are **not** compatible unless you build VTK with QT support from sources.

    There are VTK builds for Raspberry pi 4 32 bits. https://scottalford75.github.io/LinuxCNC-on-RPi/4.%20VTK%20for%20QtPyVCP.html


LinuxCNC **2.9** packages available here:

http://buildbot.linuxcnc.org/

.. Note::
    Debian 10 buster binaries work on Debian 11 bullseye

Also available from Debian 12 (bookworm) apt repository


Software Dependencies
---------------------

These packages should be installed prior to attempting to install QtPyVCP.
