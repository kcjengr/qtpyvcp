QtPyVCP is a Qt and Python based framework for building virtual control panels
for the LinuxCNC machine control.

The goal is to provide a no-code, drag-and-drop system for making simple VCPs,
as well as a straightforward, flexible and extensible framework to aid in
building complex VCPs.


## Installation and Usage

See the [documentation](https://kcjengr.github.io/qtpyvcp/).

## Hardware requirements

* CPU architecture 64 bits 
* Graphics card that supports at least OpenGl 1.30

## Dependancies

* LinuxCNC master (2.8~pre)
* Python 2.7
* PyQt5 or PySide2

QtPyVCP is developed and tested using the LinuxCNC Debian 9 x64 (stretch)
[Live ISO](http://www.linuxcnc.org/testing-stretch-rtpreempt/). It should run
on any system that can have PyQt5 installed, but Debian 9 x64 is the only OS
that is officially supported.
